            The VeriSign Secured Seal means that a site is secured by
            a VeriSign SSL Certificate and authenticated by VeriSign
            Authentication Services. The VeriSign Trust Seal provides an
            effective way to establish trust on a site without installing
            an SSL Certificate. <br><br><span style="margin-right:10px;"></span>
            SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer, a global standard
            security technology that enables encrypted communication
            between a web browser and a web server. It is utilized by
            millions1 of online businesses and individuals to decrease
            the risk of sensitive information (e.g., credit card numbers,
            usernames, passwords, emails, etc.) from being stolen or
            tampered with by hackers and identity thieves. In essence,
            SSL allows for a private “conversation” just between the
            two intended parties.
